<p id="description">Wordle is a popular game where the user has to guess a 5 letter word with only 6 attempts. With this in mind I decided to create a wordle-clone along with 2 algorithms able to solve the game with good efficiency. One based on information theory and the other with simple brute-force and random available choices. Since I did not find any portuguese (pt-pt) wordle clone I made my own with a 1000 words wordlist along with a list of frequency words more likely to be the secret word than other not so familiar words. Also discovered the best starter words in portuguese language. Made in python.</p>
